TDRE

Transcriptomic Drug Repurposing Engine (TDRE)

The Transcriptomic Drug Repurposing Engine (TDRE) is a structured system designed to generate research hypotheses for drug repurposing in rare and orphan diseases using transcriptomic data. TDRE orchestrates computational tools (e.g., differential expression analysis, signature inversion scoring) while maintaining strict epistemic separation between factual data retrieval, statistical inference, and heuristic ranking layers.

Rare and orphan diseases often lack dedicated drug development efforts. Transcriptomic datasets (e.g., bulk RNA-seq) may exist but are underutilized for systematic drug repurposing.

As of now, this is not ready for others to use. But it will be soon. Once it is ready, I'll add information you'll need to run the engine.
