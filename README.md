AI Orchestrated Transcriptomic Drug Repurposing Engine (TDRE)

The AI Orchestrated Transcriptomic Drug Repurposing Engine (TDRE) is a structured AI-coordinated system designed to generate research hypotheses for drug repurposing in rare and orphan diseases using transcriptomic data. TDRE uses AI to orchestrate computational tools (e.g., differential expression analysis, signature inversion scoring) while maintaining strict epistemic separation between factual data retrieval, statistical inference, and heuristic ranking layers.

Rare and orphan diseases often lack dedicated drug development efforts. Transcriptomic datasets (e.g., bulk RNA-seq) may exist but are underutilized for systematic drug repurposing.

As of now, this is not ready for others to use. But it will be soon. Once it is ready, I'll add information you'll need to run the engine.
Please reach out if you are interested in helping out or using the tools.
